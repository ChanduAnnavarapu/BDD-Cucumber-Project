## BDD Automation Framework with Cucumber, Selenium, and Java
This project showcases a complete **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** automation framework built using **Cucumber**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, **TestNG**, and **Maven**. It is designed to automate functional UI tests for the sauce demo web application.

## Tech Stack
Java – Core programming language  
Cucumber – BDD framework for writing readable test cases  
Selenium WebDriver – UI automation  
TestNG – Test execution and assertions  
Maven – Project build and dependency management  
Git – Version control  
Jenkins – CI/CD pipeline integration  
WebDriverManager – Driver configuration and management  
Page Object Model (POM) – Design pattern for maintainability  

## Key Highlights:
1.Defined Gherkin-based feature files for clear, business-readable scenarios
2.Created step definition classes to bridge feature files with automation logic
3.Structured a TestNG-based Test Runner for suite-level control
4.Used POM design for scalable and maintainable UI testing
5.Managed dependencies and execution via Maven CLI
6.Enabled CI with Jenkins for automation and reporting
